# JackPlan Simulator

## Introduction

JackPlan strives to be a platform for evaluating codified Blackjack strategy.
At it's core it is a Blackjack simulator which allows for player strategy
plugins and evaluations of their effectiveness.

To illistrate, imagine a Basic Blackjack Strategy plugin which follows the
exact suggestions found on the Basic Strategy cards in many casinos. Further
imagine that that strategy is played in parallel 10,000 times within seconds.
An output to that simulation would be a metric which evauluates how well that
strategy performed.

Now imagine different plugins, maybe one which emplores some card counting
strategy, and one that uses a pre-trained machine learning module. These
strategies could be compared, replayed, even placed as different players at
the same table.

This project is not meant as a scheme to figure out the best strategy to win
at the casino. It is an exercise in simulation, algorithm design, and cutting
edge technologies such as machine learning.
